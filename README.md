# BayesLinearKinematics

Adjusting beliefs using Bayes linear (kinematics) rules via an R package. 

This package allows for the representation of second-order beliefs about variables to stored in a `bl` class. The package provides functions to update beliefs using standard Bayes linear rules, to update using kinematics and to perform operations on beliefs (like subseting and calculating resolutions).
